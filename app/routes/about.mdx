  About me
</h3>
<p>
  I am a Senior Clinical Scientist for a large health care + tech company in
  Chicago IL.
</p>

Human genetics, data analysis, and the integration of big data into modern web
applications is what I stay up at night thinking about.

  Background
</h3>
<div className='flex flex-col gap-2'>
I was born in western New York state where I lived until I moved to Bolivar Missouri until I went off to college, quit college and moved to Boston in 2001.
I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Massachusetts Boston, then graduate school at Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and finally I worked as a post doctoral student at The Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

After a couple of years I used my skill in interpreting genomic variants to join a small start up called Tempus labs. It's been five years and I have expanded the breadth of my understanding in genetics and have fostered emergent coding skills. I have used those skills to create new assays, support automation in production, and improve processes in between.

I'm really excited about the future in genetics and web development. I hope to find a really great position where I can use my fantastic scientific knowledge to inform data analysis, display and the development of modern web applications to view and use the data.
